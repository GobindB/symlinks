# Dotfiles Repository

Welcome to my meticulously managed chaos – my dotfiles repository. This is where I keep my configuration files in check, structured, and version-controlled, because why not make life a bit more organized amidst the digital disarray?

## Overview

### Symlinks for Configurations
I never put real content directly in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. Instead, these files are just symlinks to the real configurations kept in a subdirectory in my home folder, for example, `~/dotfiles/bashrc` and `~/dotfiles/bash_profile`. 

### Version Control
The `~/dotfiles` directory is under version control using Git and is proudly hosted on GitHub.

### Easy Setup
When setting up a new system, I clone the repository into `~/dotfiles` and recreate the symlinks. This step is currently manual, but it's not rocket science to automate (future me, take note).

## The Nitty-Gritty

1. **Symlink Creation**:
    - `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` are symlinks pointing to `~/dotfiles/bashrc` and `~/dotfiles/bash_profile`, respectively.
    - This practice is extended to other config files like `.hgrc`, `.vimrc`, and the like.

2. **Version Control**:
    - Whenever I edit one of the configuration files, I commit and push to GitHub. Then I pull the changes on every other machine.
    - This ensures that all my systems are harmoniously misconfigured in exactly the same way.

3. **Automation (or lack thereof)**:
    - Currently, creating symlinks is a manual process. But let's face it, it's a trivial task that future me can automate when feeling particularly inspired.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures all machines share the same configurations.
- **Backup and Restore**: Makes setting up a new machine a breeze.
- **Version Tracking**: Allows for tracking changes to configuration files. Plus, it's always fun to read commit messages like "Fixed that thing that broke everything."

## Example Configuration
